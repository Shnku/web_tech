## 📊 CGPA Calculation from Given SGPA

To calculate the **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)** from the provided **SGPA** values and their corresponding **credit hours**, we can use the formula:

### 📈 Formula

$$
\text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{SGPA}_i \times \text{Credit Hours}_i)}{\sum \text{Credit Hours}_i}
$$

### 📝 Given Data

- **SGPA 1**: 8.15, **Credit Hours 1**: 26
- **SGPA 2**: 8.85, **Credit Hours 2**: 26

### 🧮 Calculation Steps

1. Calculate the weighted SGPA for each semester:
   - Semester 1:  $8.15 \times 26 = 211.90$
   - Semester 2:  $8.85 \times 26 = 230.10$

2. Sum the weighted SGPA:
   - Total Weighted SGPA = $211.90 + 230.10 = 442.00$

3. Sum the total credit hours:
   - Total Credit Hours (Credit values) = $26 + 26 = 52$

4. Calculate CGPA:
   $$\text{CGPA} = \frac{442.00}{52} \approx 8.50$$

Thus, the CGPA would be approximately **8.50**.

## 📚 SGPA Calculation from Given Grade-point & Credit

The **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** is calculated using the following formula:

### 📊 SGPA Formula

$$
\text{SGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade Points} \times \text{Credit Hours})}{\sum \text{Credit Hours}}
$$

### 📝 Explanation of Terms in SGPA

- **Grade Points**: The grade points earned in each subject.
- **Credit Hours (Credit Values)**: The number of credits assigned to each subject.
- **$ \sum $** : Represents the sum of the products of grade points and credit hours for all subjects in the semester.

### 📊 SGPA Calculation from Given Data

To calculate the **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** from the provided data in the form of (Grade Points, Credit Hours), we will use the formula:

Here are the provided points and credit hours:

| Grade Points | Credit Hours |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 7            | 6            |
| 9            | 6            |
| 10           | 6            |
| 6            | 6            |
| 10           | 2            |
| 9            | 6            |
| 9            | 6            |
| 10           | 6            |
| 7            | 6            |
| 10           | 2            |

### 🧮 SGPA Calculation Steps

1. Calculate the total grade points for each entry:
   - $7 \times 6 = 42$
   - $9 \times 6 = 54$
   - $10 \times 6 = 60$
   - $6 \times 6 = 36$
   - $10 \times 2 = 20$
   - $9 \times 6 = 54$
   - $9 \times 6 = 54$
   - $10 \times 6 = 60$
   - $7 \times 6 = 42$
   - $10 \times 2 = 20$

2. Sum the total grade points:
   $$\text{Total Grade Points} = 42 + 54 + 60 + 36 + 20 + 54 + 54 + 60 + 42 + 20 =  442$$

3. Sum the total credit hours:
   $$\text{Total Credit Hours} = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 = 52$$

4. Calculate SGPA:
   $$\text{SGPA} = \frac{442}{52} \approx 8.5$$

Thus, the SGPA would be approximately **8.5**.

## 📊 Converting CGPA to Percentage

To convert **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)** to a percentage, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \text{CGPA} \times 9.5
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = \text{SGPA}\times 10 - 0.5
$$

### 📝 Explanation

- The factor **9.5** is commonly used in many educational institutions in India to convert CGPA to percentage. However, it's important to check if your institution uses a different conversion factor.

### 🧮 Example Calculation

If you have a CGPA of **8.50**, the conversion to percentage would be:

$$
\text{Percentage} = 8.50 \times 9.5 = 80.75\%
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = 8.50 \times 10 - 0.5  = 80\%
$$
